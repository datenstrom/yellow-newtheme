## How to customise a theme

You can customise the appearance of your website with HTML and CSS. All HTML files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. All CSS files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. You can change these files as you like and also add your own CSS classes. Your changes will not be overwritten when the website is updated. [Learn more about themes](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/how-to-customise-a-theme).

The default theme is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different theme can be defined in the [page settings](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core#settings-page) at the top of each page, for example `Theme: newtheme`.
