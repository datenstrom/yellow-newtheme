## How to customise a theme

You can customise the appearance of your website with HTML and CSS. All HTML files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. All CSS files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. You can change these files as you like and also add your own CSS classes. Your changes will not be overwritten when the website is updated.

The default theme is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different theme can be defined in the [page settings](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core#settings-page) at the top of each page, for example `Theme: newtheme`.
